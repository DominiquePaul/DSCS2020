1. Write a function that takes a users name as an input and then prints "hello
    [users name]" using that name
"""
# your code






"""
2. Create a dictionary with the following values: first_name=Richard,
    last_name=Feynman, favourite_number=17 and occupation=physicist.
    In further steps do the following:

2.1 Add another element to the dictionary called 'unique_id' and assign it the
    value 23764
2.2 Update the key-value-pair favourite_number to its previous value + 10
2.3 Remove the key-value-pair of last_name from the dictionary
2.4 Print all keys in the dictionary and then print all values in the dictionary
    using a loop and in that order
2.5 Make a logical statement to check whether the keys "occupation" and "age"
    are in the keys of the dictionary
"""
# your code






"""
3. Write a block of code that asks the user for the input "radius" and prints
    out the surface area of a corresponding circle. Make sure that mathematically
    determined variables are stored in a data format that is not susceptible to
    accidental changes. Also, make sure that the final result is rounded to two
    after-comma decimals.
"""

"""
4. Concatenate the following dictionaries to create a new one:

dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}
dic3={5:50, 6:60}

Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

Hint: we have not covered this in class, but you will easily find out how to do
it with some googling

"""
5. Write a function called 'odd_even' that takes one input parameter and prints out
    whether the number is even or odd
"""
# your code






"""
6. Create a function that takes the parameters (1) length (2) lower_bound and (3)
    upper_bound and that then returns a list of the length specified with random
    numbers between the lower_bound and the upper_bound
"""
# your code






"""
7. Use your previously created function to generate a list of length 1000 with
lower_bound = 0 and upper_bound = 42. Then sort this list and print the first,
the 500th and the last element respectively
"""
# your code






"""
8. Use your previously created function to generate a list of length 1000 with
lower_bound = 0 and upper_bound = 50. Then loop over the list until the program
finds the number '42'. If it finds it then print "Found number 42" and exit the
loop, so that it does not continue searching. In either case, print "finished
search" when the loop has finished without finding a 42 in it or if finding it
"""
# your code






"""
9. Again, use your previously created function to generate a list. This time of
    length 10000 with lower_bound = 0 and upper_bound = 50. Can you find a
    method that will return us with the first instance of the number 42 it finds
    in this list? Check your result, print the number by accessing the list at
    the position you find
"""

"""
10. Write a function that goes through all the numbers of from input1 and input2
    and prints out all the multiples between 3 and 7. E.g. if input1=0 and
    input2=25 the the output should be 3,6,7,9,12,14,15,18,21,24
"""
# your code






"""
11. Modify your function created in the last exercise such that instead of
    printing the numbers, the function returns two lists with the multiples of
    3 and 7 respectively

    E.g. [3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24] and [7,14,21] for input1=0 and input2=25
