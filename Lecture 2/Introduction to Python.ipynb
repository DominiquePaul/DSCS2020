When the code is compiled or interpreted, your “0.1” is already rounded to the nearest number in that format, which results in a small rounding error even before the calculation happens.\n",

    "It’s not stupid, just different. Decimal numbers cannot accurately represent a number like 1/3, so you have to round to something like 0.33 - and you don’t expect 0.33 + 0.33 + 0.33 to add up to 1, either - do you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers use binary numbers because they’re faster at dealing with those, and because for most calculations, a tiny error in the 17th decimal place doesn’t matter at all since the numbers you work with aren’t round (or that precise) anyway.\n",

    "### Why do other calculations like 0.1 + 0.4 work correctly?\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, the result (0.5) can be represented exactly as a floating-point number, and it’s possible for rounding errors in the input numbers to cancel each other out - But that can’t necessarily be relied upon (e.g. when those two numbers were stored in differently sized floating point representations first, the rounding errors might not offset each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases like 0.1 + 0.3, the result actually isn’t really 0.4, but close enough that 0.4 is the shortest number that is closer to the result than to any other floating-point number.

Many problems and solutions are posted online so you just have to google your questions (remember to add python in the search) and you will most likely find resourcs online.

One of the most popular pages where programmers ask and answer question is [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), by the end of this course you will most likely have visited that website several dozens of times!"
